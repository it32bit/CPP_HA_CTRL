# ISSUE-01: The C compiler "/usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc" is not able to compile a simple test program.
# The error log is as follows:

    CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-3.28/Modules/CMakeTestCCompiler.cmake:67 (message):The C compiler

    "/usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc"

    is not able to compile a simple test program.

    It fails with the following output:

    Change Dir: '/home/kojot/repos/ha-ctrl/build/debug/CMakeFiles/CMakeScratch/TryCompile-LsxTNo'

    CMake will not be able to correctly generate this project.

    SOLUTION:
    The READONLY keyword has been removed from all relevant section definitions in linker script 
    for compatibility with GCC10 and earlier. 
    stm32f407vgtx_FLASH.ld file is updated.

# ISSUE-02: CMake Error at cmake/gcc-arm-none-eabi.cmake:19 (set):
    Build cmake error log:
    "Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment variable CC 
    or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_C_COMPILER to the full path to the compiler, 
    or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH."

    SOLUTION:
    The path to the ARM GCC toolchain is now explicitly set in cmake/gcc-arm-none-eabi.cmake file.
    set(TOOLCHAIN_PATH "/opt/stm32cubeclt_1.19.0/GNU-tools-for-STM32/bin")
    and all relevant CMake variables are updated to use this path.

$ /opt/stm32cubeclt_1.19.0/GNU-tools-for-STM32/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
